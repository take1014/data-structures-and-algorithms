# Explanation problem 6 : Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
I used a LinkedList structure to solve this problem. First, we created two datasets of LinkedList structure, and then unified them into one object to realize 'union' and 'intersection'.


# Time Complexity
union's time complexity is `O(n)`, and space complexity is `O(n)`.
intersection's time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.
