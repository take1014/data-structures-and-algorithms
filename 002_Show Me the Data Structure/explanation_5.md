# Problem 5 : Blockchain
I created a class for blocks. I created a blockchain by adding blocks to the list with a linked list. Initialized head and tail using linked list. The head is the first block or starting block of the list and the tail is the last block or last element of the list.
I have made it possible to check with 'is_empty' to determine if the blockchain is empty.

# Time complexity
Time for appending a block is `O(1)` , and Space complexity is `O(n)`.
