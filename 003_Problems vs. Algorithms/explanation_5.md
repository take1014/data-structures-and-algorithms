## Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries
This is the Trie data structure.
I created the TrieNode and Trie classes to implement the data structure.
It is also a unique feature of the trie tree that the key prefix can be searched with a single search.


## Time and Space complexity:
The time complexity is O(n).The time is proportional to the length of prefix.(The worst key search of length m is O (m))
I think space complexity depends on the inserted string and the prefix. Therefore, if the size of the inserted string is m and the size of the prefix is n, the space complexity will be O (mn).
