## Problem 3: Rearrange Array Elements
I used quicksort to solve this problem.
After sorting the list by quick sort in ascending order, I repeated switching between the two arrays and created two maximum values.


## Time and Space complexity:
I used quicksort(O(nlog(n)) and 1 while-loop(O(n)), the time complexity is O (nlog (n)).
The space comlixity is O (n), although it depends on the size of the input array.
