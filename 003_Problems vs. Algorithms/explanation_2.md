## Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
I used binary search to find the target number from the rotated sorted array.
I searched recursively on the left and right sides of the array to find a rotated sorted aray.


## Time and Space complexity:
Since I used binary search for the search, the time complexity is O (log (n)).
The space complexity is O (1), because it only performs array operations.
