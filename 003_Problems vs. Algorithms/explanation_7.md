## Problem 7:Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
My implementation is the same as problem 5.
I added a split process to do the processing of the paths.

## Time and Space complexity:
O (n) is the time complexity because the handler method is O (n) and the lookup has O (n) complexity.
O (n) is the space complexity because the handler method is O(n) and the lookup has O(1) complexity.
