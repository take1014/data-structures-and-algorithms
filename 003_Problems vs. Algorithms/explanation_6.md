## Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
This problem is to find the minimum and maximum values in an unsorted array.
I took all the elements of the input list and found the minimum and maximum values.


## Time and Space complexity:
There is a loop depending on the size of the input list, the time complexity is O (n).
There is only one pointer, space complixity is O (1).
